Takeaways from Jeff Sutherland's _Scrum The Art of doing twice the work in half the time_


- pg.5: Gantt charts are unrealistic project steps with timelines that are always wrong. Each step flows down to the next step. Invented in WWI for war. It's all the work laid out in front, but the elegant plan never meets reality.
- pg.12: Making people prioritize 20% of the work first makes them realize they don't need the other 80%.
- pg.8: every project involves discovery of problems so gantt charts never really work. Effort into planning, trying to restrict change, trying to know the unknowable is wasted. It's not how people work and it's not how projects progress. Instead it leads to people frustrated not getting what they expected. Projects are delayed and overbudget.
- pg.11: nobody should spend their lives on meaningless work. It kills the soul.
- pg.13: AGile methodology vs Scrum. Agile methodology (AM) is the theory, Scrum the practice. AM declares the following values: people over processes; products that actually work over documenting what the product is supposed to do; collaborating with customers over negotiating with them; and responding to change over following a plan. Scrum is the framework that puts this values into practice.
- In Scrum a sprint is a two week cycle that results in a finished increment of product.
- pg.14:  team decides how much work they think they can accomplish in the cycle, they take work off a prioritized list and write them on sticky notes and put them on a wall. the team decides how many of these work items they can get done in 1 sprint. The wall and the number of stickes finished per sprint gives them a sense of baseline... how fast they can go: velocity. After the sprint is done, the team tries to figure out impediments that slow down their velocity. That way, their velocity for teh next spring can increase.
- completion dates could only be estimated once you see a team's velocity. number of tasks left to complete a project divided by velocity gives you the number of sprints to completion.
- demos are the most important part of scrum. showing it to stakeholders and customers. every two weeks sentinel, the FBI project team, would demonstrate what they'd accomplished to the the FBI stakeholders and users.
- Healthcare.gov also built using waterfall techniques and that failed. Scrum was used by the people fixing it.
