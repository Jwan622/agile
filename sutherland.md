Takeaways from Jeff Sutherland's _Scrum The Art of doing twice the work in half the time_


- pg.5: Gantt charts are unrealistic project steps with timelines that are always wrong. Each step flows down to the next step. Invented in WWI for war. It's all the work laid out in front, but the elegant plan never meets reality.
- pg.12: Making people prioritize 20% of the work first makes them realize they don't need the other 80%.
- pg.8: every project involves discovery of problems so gantt charts never really work. Effort into planning, trying to restrict change, trying to know the unknowable is wasted. It's not how people work and it's not how projects progress. Instead it leads to people frustrated not getting what they expected. Projects are delayed and overbudget.
- pg.11: nobody should spend their lives on meaningless work. It kills the soul.
- pg.13: AGile methodology vs Scrum. Agile methodology (AM) is the theory, Scrum the practice. AM declares the following values: people over processes; products that actually work over documenting what the product is supposed to do; collaborating with customers over negotiating with them; and responding to change over following a plan. Scrum is the framework that puts this values into practice.
- In Scrum a sprint is a two week cycle that results in a finished increment of product.
- pg.14:  team decides how much work they think they can accomplish in the cycle, they take work off a prioritized list and write them on sticky notes and put them on a wall. the team decides how many of these work items they can get done in 1 sprint. The wall and the number of stickes finished per sprint gives them a sense of baseline... how fast they can go: velocity.
- pg.27: Anytime there's organizational change, gotta be careful taht the organization doesn't settle into a new toxic steady state.
- pg.33: The link that kevin shared about nursing: [agile nursing](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/nursing/projects/Documents/novice-expert-benner.pdf) is kind of like using Takeuchi and Nonaka's paper on manufacturing agile but for the use case of software. The parallel is real.
- pg.35: the paper airplane that we did at Stride is a scrum exercise from the Sutherland book lol.
- FGunny enough, BellSouth did waterfall well, but the thing is even if you deliver a project that follows the Gantt chart requirements to the T, the customer after 2 years no longer wnated what they say they wanted. Get continuous feedback so that you change along the way with the customer. You're wrong even if you do it right re: waterfall.
- With SCrum, you gotta do to understand.


**On Teams**
- teams are what get work done. which is weird... the world rewards actors with bonuses and salaries. everyone is focused on the actor. That seems like a mistake.
- Good teams are cross functional and autonomous. autonomous meaning they are self organization and self managing and hae the power to make their own decisions. IN cross functional teams, someone's info becomes the team's.
- pg.48: in good teams, there is freedom to do your job in the way that you think is best. it's left to members to decide how to carry out the goals. 
- pg.50: key concept in scrum is that teh team members decide themselves how they're going to work. Like blackboard. Neat how Scrum is used at NPR now.
